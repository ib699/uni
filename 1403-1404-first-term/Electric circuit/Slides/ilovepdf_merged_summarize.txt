   - **Example Usage**: In an Op-Amp circuit, if the gain (A) is 1000, V^+ = 2V, and V^- = 0.1V, then V_out = 1000 * (2V - 0.1V) = 1900V.

2. **V_out = - (R_f / R_in) * V_in**  
   - **Example Usage**: In an inverting amplifier, if R_f = 10 kÎ©, R_in = 1 kÎ©, and V_in = 5V, then V_out = - (10 kÎ© / 1 kÎ©) * 5V = -50V.

3. **V_out = (1 + (R_f / R_in)) * V_in**  
   - **Example Usage**: In a non-inverting amplifier, if R_f = 20 kÎ©, R_in = 5 kÎ©, and V_in = 2V, then V_out = (1 + (20 kÎ© / 5 kÎ©)) * 2V = 10V.
